Array funs is created. 
/* Variable is set to let */
A for loop goes through 10 iterations.
Each iteration adds a .push function to the array.
The .push function contains a function that gets the paragraph element and changes the inner html to be the current iteration number plus the previous iteration numbers.
A for loop at the bottom goes through each iteration in funs and runs the corresponding function in the array.
The output is 12345678910.

/* Variable is set to var */
All is similar to the previous case except for one exception.
Because the for loop variable is set to var then that creates hoisting in javascript.
This causes the variable to be hoisted as its last assigned value and when the function is called it displays 11 instead of its corresponding number like the case above.
The output is 11111111111111111111.
