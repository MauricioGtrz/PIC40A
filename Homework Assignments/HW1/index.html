        <h2>The Three Little Pigs</h2>
        <p>
          The Story of the Three Little Pigs Three pigs came to town on a warm
          summer’s day, and they said to each other what a nice place to stay.
          They each made their plans with remarkable speed, and they went out to
          look for the things they would need. The first little pig built a
          house made of straw, he thatched and he thatched till he couldn’t
          thatch any more. He worked every day till his trotters were sore, then
          early one evening came a knock on the door. "Little pig, little pig
          won’t you let me come in?" "No, no, no, by the hair on my chinny,
          chin, chin." "Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house
          in." No, no, no, Mr. Wolf I will not let you in." So he huffed, and he
          puffed, and he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in The
          second little pig built a house made of sticks, he paid close
          attention to all the fiddley bits. With curtains on the windows and
          carpet on the floor, then early one evening came a knock on the door.
          "Little pig, little pig won’t you let me come in?" "No, no, no, by the
          hair on my chinny, chin, chin." "Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll
          blow your house in." No, no, no, Mr. Wolf I will not let you in." So
          he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed
          and he puffed and he blew the house in The third little pig built a
          house made of bricks, which he felt would be stronger than straw or
          than sticks. He painted the ceiling and he painted the walls, then
          early one evening came a knock on the door. "Little pig, little pig
          won’t you let me come in?" "No, no, no, by the hair on my chinny,
          chin, chin." "Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house
          in." No, no, no, Mr. Wolf I will not let you in." So he huffed, and he
          puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed,
          and he huffed and he puffed but it did not blow in Now the three
          little pigs each had a house made of bricks, so they wouldn’t have to
          worry bout the wolf and his tricks.

        <h2>The Patient Cat</h2>
        <p>
          WHEN the spotted cat first found the nest, there was nothing in it,
          for it was only just finished. So she said, “I will wait!” for she was
          a patient cat, and the summer was before her. She waited a week, and
          then she climbed up again to the top of the tree, and peeped into the
          nest. There lay two lovely blue eggs, smooth and shining. The spotted
          cat said, “Eggs may be good, but young birds are better. I will wait.”
          So she waited; and while she was waiting, she caught mice and rats,
          and washed herself and slept, and did all that a spotted cat should do
          to pass the time away. When another week had passed, she climbed the
          tree again and peeped into the[58] nest. This time there were five
          eggs. But the spotted cat said again, “Eggs may be good, but young
          birds are better. I will wait a little longer!” So she waited a little
          longer and then went up again to look. Ah! there were five tiny birds,
          with big eyes and long necks, and yellow beaks wide open. Then the
          spotted cat sat down on the branch, and licked her nose and purred,
          for she was very happy. “It is worth while to be patient!” she said.
          But when she looked again at the young birds, to see which one she
          should take first, she saw that they were very thin,—oh, very, very
          thin they were! The spotted cat had never seen anything so thin in her
          life. “Now,” she said to herself, “if I were to wait only a few days
          longer, they would grow fat. Thin birds may be good, but fat birds are
          much better. I will wait!” So she waited; and she watched the
          father-bird bringing worms all day long to the nest, and said, “Aha!
          they must be fattening fast! they will soon be as fat as I wish them
          to be. Aha! what a good thing it is to be patient.” At last, one day
          she thought, “Surely, now they must be fat enough! I will not wait
          another day. Aha! how good they will be!” So she climbed up the tree,
          licking her chops all the way and thinking of the fat young birds. And
          when she reached the top and looked into the nest, it was empty!! Then
          the spotted cat sat down on the branch and spoke thus, “Well, of all
          the horrid, mean, ungrateful creatures I ever saw, those birds are the
          <em>horridest</em>, and the <em>meanest</em>, and the
          <em>most ungrateful</em>! <em>Mi-a-u-ow</em>!!!!”

        <h2>Little Red Riding Hood</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near
          the forest. Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding
          cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.
          One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go
          to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each
          other. "That's a good idea," her mother said. So they packed a nice
          basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother. When the
          basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her
          mother goodbye. "Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother
          cautioned. "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to
          strangers! The woods are dangerous." "Don't worry, mommy," said Little
          Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful." Little Red Riding Hood StoryBut
          when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods,
          she forgot her promise to her mother. She picked a few, watched the
          butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and
          then picked a few more. Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm
          summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching
          out of the forest behind her... Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside
          her. "What are you doing out here, little girl?" the wolf asked in a
          voice as friendly as he could muster. "I'm on my way to see my Grandma
          who lives through the forest, near the brook," Little Red Riding Hood
          replied. Then she realized how late she was and quickly excused
          herself, rushing down the path to her Grandma's house. The wolf, in
          the meantime, took a shortcut... The wolf, a little out of breath from
          running, arrived at Grandma's and knocked lightly at the door. "Oh
          thank goodness dear! Come in, come in! I was worried sick that
          something had happened to you in the forest," said Grandma thinking
          that the knock was her granddaughter. The wolf let himself in. Poor
          Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled
          her up! The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through
          Granny's wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked. He added a frilly
          sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny's perfume
          behind his pointy ears. A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked
          on the door. The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his
          nose. "Who is it?" he called in a cackly voice. "It's me, Little Red
          Riding Hood." "Oh how lovely! Do come in, my dear," croaked the wolf.
          When Little Red Riding Hood entered the little cottage, she could
          scarcely recognize her Grandmother. "Grandmother! Your voice sounds so
          odd. Is something the matter?" she asked. "Oh, I just have touch of a
          cold," squeaked the wolf adding a cough at the end to prove the point.
          "But Grandmother! What big ears you have," said Little Red Riding Hood
          as she edged closer to the bed. "The better to hear you with, my
          dear," replied the wolf. "But Grandmother! What big eyes you have,"
          said Little Red Riding Hood. "The better to see you with, my dear,"
          replied the wolf. "But Grandmother! What big teeth you have," said
          Little Red Riding Hood her voice quivering slightly. "The better to
          eat you with, my dear," roared the wolf and he leapt out of the bed
          and began to chase the little girl. Almost too late, Little Red Riding
          Hood realized that the person in the bed was not her Grandmother, but
          a hungry wolf. She ran across the room and through the door, shouting,
          "Help! Wolf!" as loudly as she could. A woodsman who was chopping logs
          nearby heard her cry and ran towards the cottage as fast as he could.
          He grabbed the wolf and made him spit out the poor Grandmother who was
          a bit frazzled by the whole experience, but still in one piece."Oh
          Grandma, I was so scared!" sobbed Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll never
          speak to strangers or dawdle in the forest again." "There, there,
          child. You've learned an important lesson. Thank goodness you shouted
          loud enough for this kind woodsman to hear you!" The woodsman knocked
          out the wolf and carried him deep into the forest where he wouldn't
          bother people any longer. Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother
          had a nice lunch and a long chat.
