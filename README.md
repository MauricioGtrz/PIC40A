# PIC40A

This is a repository containing all of my completed assignments from UCLA's course: Program in Computing 40A. As you can see I have separated the assignments into two folders. The participation assignments are shorter assignments that need to be completed after every lecture with the skills that I learned the previous lecture. Homework assignments are larger assignments that usually require several days or a week to complete using the accumulated knowledge acquired from the class.
